The liqidity performance is related to the release of information.  [Bank of America earnings reports](http://investor.bankofamerica.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71595&p=quarterlyearnings#fbid=9jxIU82wTz4) show dates of last 8 reports as 

* October 14 2015
* July 15 2015
* April 15 2015
* January 15 2015
* October 15 2014
* July 16 2014
* April 16 2014
* January 15 2014
* October 16 2013
* July 17 2013
* April 17 2013
* January 17 2013


Download data and add the liquidity index.  Liquidity index is calculated as 

$$L = \frac{|R_t|}{Vol_t}$$

where $|R_t|$ is the absolute value of the return, $Vol_t$ is the volume traded.  The index is then smoothed over 20 days to get the following results.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(zoo)
BAC <- read.csv("Other/BACLI.csv")
BAC$Date <- as.Date(BAC$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
BAC <- BAC[rev(rownames(BAC)),]
BACR <- diff(BAC$Close) / BAC$Close[-length(BAC$Close)] 
BAC <- cbind(BAC[-1,], BACR)
LI <- abs(BAC$BACR)/BAC$Volume*10000000
LIS <- rollmean(BACR, k = 10)
plot(BAC$Date[1:708], LIS, type ='l', main = "BAC Liquidity Index", xlab = "Date")
BAC <- cbind(BAC[-c(1:9), ], LIS)
```

Now add the dates to the graph. As red lines.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(BAC$Date[1:708], LIS, type ='l', main = "BAC Liquidity Index", xlab = "Date")
earnings.Dates <- c("14-10-2015", "15-07-2015", "15-04-2015", "15-01-2015", "15-10-2014", "16-07-2014", "16-04-2014", "15-01-2014",
                    "16-10-2013", "17-07-2013", "17-04-2013", "17-01-2013")
earnings.Dates <- as.Date(earnings.Dates, format = "%d-%m-%Y")
abline(v = earnings.Dates, col = "red")
```

There does not appear to be any particular pattern around the time of the earnings reports. However, if we create some dummies for before and after the date, these can be used to assess the  
 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
BAC$D1 <- NA
BAC$D1 <- as.numeric(BAC$Date %in% earnings.Dates)
# One day before
BAC$D2 <- NA
BAC$D2 <- as.numeric((BAC$Date + 1) %in% earnings.Dates)
# One day after
BAC$D3
BAC$D3 <- as.numeric((BAC$Date - 1) %in% earnings.Dates)
eq1 <- lm(BAC$LIS ~ BAC$D1 + BAC$D2 + BAC$D3)
summary(eq1)
```
None of these dummies that have been created (D1 = 1 on day of earnings; D2 = 1 on day before earnings; D3 = 1 on day after earnings). 

Maybe an event study would be better.
